# WebAssembly Experiments

Loosely-coupled collection of quick-and-dirty experiments.

Create one sub-folder per experiment, each with their own `README.md` and
`LICENSE`, or default to the Apache 2.0 license which otherwise covers this
repository.

Make sure that any third party code used in your experiments is contained in the
root `third_party` folder of this repository.

Don't fret over code reviews, pull requests and issue tracking in this
repository: it's the wild west, and mostly anything goes.

Happy assembling!
